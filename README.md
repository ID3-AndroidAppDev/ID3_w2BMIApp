This repository contains the Android Studio versions of the apps developed in the Introduction to Design Track 3 (ID3) course. ID3 is an introductory Android development course designed for beginners, offered every spring semester to freshmen at Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS), Japan.

In the ID3 course, MIT App Inventor serves as the official IDE, providing a visual programming environment for students to create Android apps. This repository hosts the Android Studio refactors of those apps, most of which have been adapted into smartwatch apps to enhance portability and accessibilityâ€”pushing the boundaries of app development and enabling seamless, ubiquitous interactions directly on the wrist.

The instructor and TAs of the ID3 course are affiliated with the Ubiquitous and Personal Computing (UBICOMP) Lab at KUAS, where one of the primary research focuses is on smartwatch interaction and smartwatch-supported health behavior change.
