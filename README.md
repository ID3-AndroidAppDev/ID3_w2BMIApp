# Description
This repository contains the Android Studio implementation of the BMI app developed during Week 2 of the Introduction to Design Track 3 (ID3) course. The app calculates users' Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their body weight and height. 


# Miscellaneous
### The ID3 Course
ID3 is an introductory Android development course designed for beginners, offered every spring semester to freshmen at Kyoto University of Advanced Science (KUAS), Japan. In the ID3 course, MIT App Inventor serves as the official IDE, providing a visual programming environment for students to create Android apps. This repository hosts the Android Studio refactors of those apps, most of which have been adapted into smartwatch apps to enhance portability and accessibilityâ€”pushing the boundaries of app development and enabling seamless, ubiquitous interactions directly on the wrist.

We have been offering the ID3 course since 2020 and have published several papers at prestigious educational conferences and journals. For more details, refer to the following publications:

### The Research Group
The instructor and TAs of the ID3 course are affiliated with the Ubiquitous and Personal Computing (UBICOMP) Lab at KUAS, where one of the primary research focuses is on smartwatch interaction and smartwatch-supported health behavior change.
